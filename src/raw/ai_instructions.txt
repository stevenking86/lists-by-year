// Notes for the AI: Please take a look at the other files in this folder (or the specific ones you were instructed to look at).
//  Then look at the format of data.json.
// We want to take the unstructured data in these files and put it in data.json in the format that
// is there. You should be able to figure out the year, category, author, and items from these files. 
// If things aren't numbered, feel free to number them. 
// Feel free to edit spacing and tabs and formatting if necessary. 

// Only possible categories: TV, Movies, Video Games, Music, Podcasts, Documentaries, Docuseries 
// Only possible authors: Steven, Grayson, Robbie, Carrie Ann, Amanda, Paul, Zach

// There might be strange situations like ties or "a" and "b" entries for a given list item. When faced with
// strange issues like this, use your discretion to either combine them into 1 list item or break them up 
// even if that causes renumbering.  Don't do something like restructure the json format please.
